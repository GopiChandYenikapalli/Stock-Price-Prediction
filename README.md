Analysis
Based on the above performance evaluation values, both the Simple RNN and LSTM RNN models have performed reasonably well in predicting Delta Airlines' closing price.

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is an important metric that measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. In this case, the MSE for the Simple RNN model is 1.88, while for the LSTM RNN model, it's 1.76. This indicates that the LSTM model is slightly better at predicting the closing price than the Simple RNN model.

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is another important metric that measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. The MAE for the Simple RNN model is 1.01, while for the LSTM RNN model, it's 0.98. This indicates that the LSTM model is slightly better at predicting the closing price than the Simple RNN model.

The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is a useful metric that measures the average percentage difference between the predicted and actual values. The MAPE for the Simple RNN model is 2.53%, while for the LSTM RNN model, it's 2.46%. This indicates that both models have performed similarly in terms of predicting the closing price with respect to the percentage error.

The Median Absolute Percentage Error (MDAPE) is another useful metric that measures the median percentage difference between the predicted and actual values. The MDAPE for the Simple RNN model is 1.91%, while for the LSTM RNN model, it's 1.81%. This indicates that both models have performed similarly in terms of predicting the closing price with respect to the median percentage error.

In conclusion, based on the performance metrics, the LSTM RNN model has performed slightly better than the Simple RNN model in predicting Delta Airlines' closing price.
